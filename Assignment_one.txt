What is an Application Package?

An application package is a bundle of files and metadata required to install and run an application. In Windows, modern application packages come in the MSIX format, which is a successor to older formats like .msi and .exe.

Key Features of MSIX:

Reliable and clean installation
Automatic updates
Improved security and app isolation
Simplified deployment (supports sideloading and enterprise tools)
MSIX is widely used for deploying desktop, UWP, and enterprise apps.


Steps to Install an MSIX Package:

1.Meet System Requirements

Windows 10 version 1809 or later
Power-shell 5.1+ or Windows Terminal
Admin access (for some installations)

2.Enable Sideloading (if needed)

If the app is not from the Microsoft Store:

Go to Settings > Update & Security > For Developers
Choose Sideload apps
Confirm when prompted

3.Obtain the MSIX File

Get the .msix or .appx file from:
A trusted website
Internal enterprise network or a App developer or IT department.

4.Install via GUI (Double-click Method)

Locate the .msix file
Double-click it
Click Install in the popup window






5.Install via PowerShell:

Useful for scripted or advanced installations:
Powershell

=>Add-AppxPackage -Path "C:\Path\To\App.msix"

If the package requires frameworks or dependencies, install them first using the same command format.

6.Verify Installation

Check if the app is installed:

Search for it in the Start Menu or run command on:

Powershell

=>Get-AppxPackage -Name "*AppName*"
